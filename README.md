## Overview

PRSformer is a scalable deep learning architecture designed for end-to-end, multitask disease prediction directly from million-scale individual genotypes. It uses neighborhood attention, achieving linear O(L) complexity per layer, making Transformers tractable for genome-scale inputs. This design allows PRSformer to learn complex, potentially non-linear, and long-range interactions directly from raw genotypes.

## Model Architecture

The PRSformer architecture is built using PyTorch and consists of the following key components:

-   **`g2p_transformer_ExplicitNaNDose2`**: The main model class. It handles the learnable embeddings for genetic variants (SNPs) and their dosages. It distinguishes between observed genotypes and missing data, which is crucial for real-world genomic datasets.
-   **`TransformerLayer`**: At the core of PRSformer are stacked Transformer layers. These layers use Neighborhood Attention (`MultiHeadAttention_natten`) to efficiently model local dependencies within the genome, which is a key to the model's scalability.
-   **`PhenoHead_FC_on_flatten`**: After processing the genomic sequence through the Transformer layers, a phenotype head is used to predict disease risk. This module flattens the output of the transformer and passes it through a fully connected layer to generate predictions for multiple diseases in a multi-task setting.

The code is organized into two main files:
-   `src/model.py`: Contains the main model architectures, including `g2p_transformer_ExplicitNaNDose2`.
-   `src/modules.py`: Contains the building blocks of the models, such as `TransformerLayer`, `MultiHeadAttention_natten`, and various `PhenoHead` implementations.



## Dependencies
- Python ≥ 3.9
